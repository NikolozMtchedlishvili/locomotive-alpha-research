📄 [2025 Annual Report (PDF)] [Locomotive-Alpha Partners – 2025 Annual Report.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25346707/Locomotive-Alpha.Partners.2025.Annual.Report.pdf)



This project is a Python-based market analysis tool that combines financial data, news events, and macroeconomic indicators to visualize how markets react to news and economic updates.

The goal: to better understand the drivers of market movements, including sentiment, monetary policy, geopolitical events, and corporate earnings.

By building this model, my educational macro-focused investment portfolio in 2025 generated **55.33% Time-Weighted Return (TWR)**, compared to the S&P 500 (VOO)'s TWR of **17.82%**.
